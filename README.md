## Key Features

- **Side Panel Interface:** Instead of a conventional browser window, Sidesurf lives in a panel on the side of your screen. This design is perfect for quick lookups, multitasking, or keeping a reference page open without sacrificing screen real estate from your primary application.

- **Vertical Tab Management:** Say goodbye to horizontal tab clutter. Sidesurf uses a vertical tab strip, making it easier to manage and navigate through numerous pages.

- **Total Shortcut Customization:** Personalize your browsing experience by mapping nearly every action to your preferred keyboard shortcuts. This level of control allows for a faster and more intuitive workflow tailored to your habits.

- **Hands-Free Voice Integration:** Leverage the power of AI with built-in voice command support. Interact directly with services like ChatGPT and Copilot for a truly hands-free browsing and research experience.

- **Workflow Automation:** Define and execute custom workflows to automate repetitive tasks. Whether it's a sequence of sites you visit daily or complex data-gathering, the workflow feature acts as your personal browsing assistant.

- **AI-Powered Text Widget:** Highlight any text on a webpage to summon an intelligent widget. Use customizable "Prompt Tags" to instantly perform actions like summarizing an article, explaining a concept, debugging a code snippet, or translating foreign text.

## Getting Started

### Installation
The easiest way to get started is to download the latest version from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Punit-Dethe/SideSurf/releases) page.

### Configuration & Usage Tips

*   **Sign in to Google (Optional):** For a more integrated experience, you can sign in to your Google account. This can enhance functionality across various Google services.

*   **User Agent Settings:** By default, Sidesurf uses a standard Chrome user agent to ensure compatibility. However, some services, like ChatGPT, may work more reliably with a different agent after you've signed into a Google account. We recommend switching your user agent *once* in the settings after your initial Google login for the best results.

*   **Website Shortcuts:** Use the settings to create shortcuts to your most frequently visited websites for even faster navigation.

## Future Updates

We are continuously working to improve Sidesurf. Here are some of the features and enhancements on our roadmap:

*   **UI/UX Overhaul:** A complete redesign of the user interface for a more modern, intuitive, and visually appealing experience.
*   **Image Widget:** Similar to the text widget, you'll be able to interact with any image on a webpage or from your local files. This will include features for analysis, annotation, and quick sharing.
*   **Taskbar Stability:** We are working on improving the browser's stability and integration with the operating system's taskbar.
*   **Integrated Notes & Screenshot Storage:** A new system for capturing, storing, and organizing your screenshots and notes directly within the browser.
